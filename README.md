# .zdots
my zsh dotfiles

Run in the terminal -- git clone https://github.com/rocco949/.zdots.git ~ && mv ~/.zshrc ~/.zshrcbackup && touch ~/.zshrc && open ~/.zshrc --

When the .zshrc opens up, paste in -- source ~/.zdots/.zsource --

If you want to delete, run -- rm -R ~/.zdots && rm ~/.zshrc && mv ~/.zshrcbackup ~/.zshrc --

to see the aliases, run -- editli --
to see all the dotfiles run -- edit --

That's it.
